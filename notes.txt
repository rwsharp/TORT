for the backpacking branch, the big change will be to shift from day-by-day 
travel to mile-by-mile travel. You're on foot, you have limited rations and
gear. No oxen and carts. Health is more closely tied to energy. As you travel
you do work (in the physics sense) and you must consume food and water and 
rest from time to time to get it back. I think we should still stick to the 
idea of a discrete trail (you travel 1 mile at a time), but let the idea of
time become continuous (that mile will take you a more precise amount of
time than a day). Time of day will come into it - you travel slowly after dark.
Weather is a bigger threat than bears. So the threats are now: 
exposure/weather, health/energy drain, falls, minor injuries that slow the 
party, thirst (you need to find water or carry enough - so pack weight will
come into it), more detailed terrain (especially grade).

* more complex travel speed model (grade, time of day, weather condition 
[sun, rain, thunder, hail, snow])

* more complex health model (every mile draws down energy, must consume food,
water, and rest to offset)

* loop trails
